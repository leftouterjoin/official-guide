\section{Purpose of the Scrum@Scale Guide}
\fi
\section{Scrum@Scaleガイドの目的}
\if0
Scrum, as originally outlined in the Scrum Guide, is a framework for
developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products by a single team.
Since its inception, its usage has extended to the creation of products,
processes, services, and systems that require the efforts of multiple
teams. Scrum@Scale was created to efficiently coordinate this new ecosystem
of teams in a way that optimizes the overall strategy of the organization.
It achieves this goal through setting up a ``minimum viable bureaucracy''
via a scale-free architecture, which naturally extends the way a single
Scrum team functions across the organization.
\fi
スクラムは、もともとスクラムガイドで概説されているように、単一のチームに
よって複雑なプロダクトを開発、提供、および維持することができる。
発行以来、複数チームの協力が求められる、プロダクト、プロセス、サービス、システム
などの開発にまで広がりを見せている。
Scrum@Scaleは、組織戦略の全体を最適化する方法として、チームの新しいエコシ
ステムを効率的に調整するために作成された。
これは、単一スクラムチームを、組織で機能横断的に自然に拡張するというスケー
ルフリーなアーキテクチャにより、``最小で実行可能な官僚制''の実現という
ゴールを達成するものである。

\if0
This guide contains the definitions of the components that make up the
Scrum@Scale framework, including its scaled roles, scaled events, and
enterprise artifacts, as well as the rules that bind them together.
\fi
このガイドには、Scrum@Scale フレームワーク、スケール化ルール、スケール化イベント、
といったコンポーネントの定義と、エンタープライズ向け成果物、およびそれらを結び

\if0
Dr. Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum@Scale based on the fundamental
principles behind Scrum, Complex Adaptive Systems theory, game theory, and
object-oriented technology. This guide was developed with the input of many
experienced Scrum practitioners based on the results of their field work.
The goal of this guide is for the reader to be able to implement Scrum@Scale
\fi
ジェフ・サザランド博士は、スクラムの背後にある原則、複雑な適応システム理論、
ゲーム理論、オブジェクト指向技術に基づきScrum@Scaleを開発した。
このガイドは、多くの経験豊かなスクラムの実践者のフィールドワークの結果に基づい
て開発されている。
このガイドは、読者が、自分自身でScrum@Scaleを実践できることをゴールにしている。

\subsection{Why Scrum@Scale?}
\fi
\subsection{なぜScrum@Scaleか?}
\if0
Scrum was designed for a single team to be able to work at its optimal
capacity while maintaining a sustainable pace. In the field, it was found
that as the number of Scrum teams within an organization grew, the 
output (working product) and velocity of those teams began to fall (due to
issues like cross-team dependencies and duplication of work). It became
obvious that a framework for effectively coordinating those teams was
needed in order to achieve linear scalability. Scrum@Scale is designed to
accomplish this goal via its scale-free architecture.
\fi
スクラムは、単一のチームが、持続可能なペースを維持する間その最適な能力で働く
ことができるようにデザインされている。
現場では、組織内のスクラムチーム数の増加に伴いアウトプット(プロダクト)とベロ
シティの低下が見受けられる(冗長な作業やチーム横断依存のような問題のため)。
リニアなスケーラビリティを得るためには、複数のチームを効果的に調整するための
フレームワークが必要性が明白である。
Scrum@Scaleは、スケールフリーアーキテクチャでゴールを達成するためにデザイン
されている。

\if0
By utilizing a scale-free architecture, the organization is not constrained
to grow in a particular way determined by a set of arbitrary rules; rather
it can grow organically based on its unique needs and at a sustainable pace
of change that can be accepted by the groups of individuals that make up
the organization. The simplicity of the Scrum@Scale model is essential to a scale-free architecture and carefully avoids introducing extra complexity that will cause productivity per team to decrease as more teams are created.
\fi
スケールフリーのアーキテクチャを利用することによって、組織は成長するための特定
の方法に任意の規則のセットの決定や方法を強制されない。
むしろ、それは、そのユニークなニーズ、および組織を作る個人のグループにより受け
入れられうる変化の持続可能なペースに有機的に基づくかもしれない。
Scrum@Scaleモデルのシンプルさはスケールフリーのアーキテクチャに必須で、チーム
あたり生産性を、より多くのチームが作成されると減少させる特別な複雑さを導入する
ことを慎重に避ける。

\if0
Scrum@Scale is designed to scale across the organization as a whole: all
departments, products and services. It can be applied across multiple
domains in all types of organizations in industry, government, or academia.
Scrum@Scaleは、すべての部門、プロダクト、およびサービスといった、組織全体を横断的に

\subsection{Definition of Scrum@Scale}
\fi
\subsection{Scrum@Scaleの定義}
\if0
Scrum: A framework within which people can address complex adaptive
problems, while productively and creatively delivering viable products of the
highest possible value.
\fi
スクラム: 現実的で高い価値を持つプロダクトを、生産的に創造的にデリバリする間人々が
複雑な問題に順応的に対処できるフレームワーク。

\if0
The Scrum Guide is the minimal feature set that allows inspection and
adaptability via radical transparency to drive innovation, customer satisfaction, performance, and
team happiness.
\fi
スクラムガイドは、根本的な透明度を経た検査と適応性が革新、顧客満足、性能、
およびチーム幸福を動かすことを可能にする最小の機能セットである。

\if0
Scrum@Scale: A framework within which networks of Scrum teams operating
consistently with the Scrum Guide can address complex adaptive problems,
while creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
Scrum@Scale: 現実的で高い価値を持つプロダクトを創造的に提供する間、
\fi
スクラムガイドによって一貫して動作しているスクラムチームのネットワークが複雑
な順応的な問題に対処できるフレームワーク。

\if0
\textbf{NOTE:} These ``products'' may be hardware, software, complex
integrated systems, processes, services, etc., depending upon the domain of
the Scrum teams.
\fi
\textbf{注意:} これら ``プロダクト'' は、スクラムチームによって、ハードウェア、
ソフトウェア、複雑な統合されたシステム、プロセス、サービスなどであるかもしれない。

\if0
Scrum@Scale is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lightweight - the minimum viable bureaucracy
\item Simple to understand - consists of only Scrum teams
\item Difficult to master - requires implementing a new operating model
\end{itemize}
\fi
Scrum@Scale とは:
\begin{itemize}
\item 軽量 - 最小で実行可能な官僚制
\item 理解しやすい - スクラムチームだけから成る
\item 習得は難しい - 新しい運用モデルを身に着ける必要がある
\end{itemize}

\if0
Scrum@Scale is a framework for scaling Scrum. It radically simplifies
scaling by using Scrum to scale Scrum. 
\fi
Scrum@Scaleは、スクラムをスケールするためのフレームワークである。
それは、スクラムをスケールするために、スクラムを使用してスケールすることを
根本的に簡素化する。

\if0
In Scrum, care is taken to separate accountability of the ``what'' from the
``how''. The same care is taken in Scrum@Scale so that jurisdiction and
accountability are expressly understood in order to eliminate wasteful
organizational conflict that keep teams from achieving their optimal
productivity.
\fi
スクラムでは、``どのように''からの``何を'' の責任の分離するために気をつける。
チームが、それらの最適な生産性を達成することを防ぐ無駄な組織的な衝突を取り
除くために、司法権と責任が明確に理解されるように、Scrum@Scaleに同じに気をつける。

\if0
Scrum@Scale consists of components that allow an organization to
customize their transformational strategy and implementation. It gives them
the ability to target their incrementally prioritized change efforts in the area(s) they deem
most valuable or most in need of change and then progress on to others.
\fi
Scrum@Scaleは、組織がそれらの変形の戦略とインプリメンテーションをカスタマイズ
することを可能にするコンポーネントから成る。
変化と、進歩の必要において彼らが他に最も考えている 最も貴重なまたは
エリア（s）でのそれらのますます優先度を付けられた変化努力をターゲットとする
ことは、彼らに能力を与える。

\if0
In separating these two jurisdictions, Scrum@Scale contains two cycles: the
Scrum Master Cycle (the ``how'') and the Product Owner Cycle (the
``what''), each touching the other at two points. Taken together, these
cycles produce a powerful framework for coordinating the efforts of
multiple teams along a single path.
\fi
これら2つの管轄を隔てうえで、Scrum@Scaleは、2つのサイクルを含んでいる:
スクラムマスターサイクル(``どのように'')、およびプロダクトオーナーサイクル
(``何を'')、それぞれ、2ポイントで他に触れる。
一緒に取られて、これらのサイクルは、単一のパスに沿って複数のチームの努力を
調整するための強力な枠組を作り出す。

\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{SMPO-Cycle.png}

\if0
\subsection{Values-Driven Culture}
\fi
\subsection{価値駆動文化}
\if0
Besides separating accountability of the ``what'' and the ``how,''
Scrum@Scale further aims to build healthy organizations by creating a
values-driven culture in an empirical setting. The Scrum values are:
Openness, Courage, Focus, Respect, and Commitment. These values drive
empirical decision making, which depend on the three pillars of
transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
\fi
``何を'' および``どのように''の責任の分離以外では、Scrum@Scaleにおいて、
経験の設定において価値駆動の文化を醸成して健康な組織を築くことがより一層
重要である。スクラムにおける価値とは次のようなものがある:開放性、勇気、
集中、敬意、コミットメント。これらの価値によって、経験の意思決定を駆動する。
それは、透明性、検査、および適応の3つの柱に依存する。

\if0
Openness supports transparency into all of the work and processes, without
which there is no ability to inspect them honestly and attempt to adapt
them for the better. Courage refers to taking the bold leaps required to
deliver value quicker in innovative ways.
\fi
開放性は、それらを正直に検査し、それらをさらによいものに適応させることを
試みる能力が全然ない仕事とプロセスのうちのすべてに透明度をサポートする。
勇気は、革新的な方法でより迅速な価値を配達するために必要な大胆な飛躍を取る
ことを示す。

\if0
Focus and Commitment refer to the way we handle our work obligations,
putting customer value delivery as the highest priority. Lastly, all of
this must occur in an environment based on respect for the individuals
doing the work, without whom nothing can be created.
\fi
集中とコミットメントは、私達が私達の職務を処理する方法を示し、顧客へ価値を
届けることを最も高いプライオリティとする。
最後に、これらすべては、他にだれも成しえないことを行っている、作業者個人
個人への深い敬意に基づいた環境に生まれるにちがいない。

\if0
Scrum@Scale helps organizations thrive by supporting a
transformational leadership model which fosters a positive environment for
working at a sustainable pace and putting commitment to deliver
customer-facing value at the forefront of our efforts.
\fi
Scrum@Scaleは、組織が、持続可能なペースで、顧客直面価値を私達の努力の最前線
に提供するという制約を作動させて、置くためのポジティブな環境を養育する変形
のリーダーシップモデルをサポートして繁栄することを手助けする。

\if0
\subsection{Getting Started with Scrum@Scale}
\fi
\subsection{Scrum@Scaleを始める}
\if0
When implementing large networks of teams, it is critical to develop a
scalable \textbf{Reference Model} for a small set of teams. Any
deficiencies in a Scrum implementation will be magnified when multiple
teams are deployed. Many of the initial scaling problems will be organizational 
policies and procedures or development practices that block high performance and frustrate 
teams. 
\fi
大きなチームネットワークを構築する際は、小さなチームのセットのためのスケー
ラブルな\textbf{参照モデル}を開発することは重要である。
複数のチームが配備される時には、スクラムインプリメンテーションのどのような
欠点にも対してでも拡張されるだろう。
初期のスケーリング問題の多くは、組織方針と手続きや、ハイパフォーマンスを
阻む開発プラクティスとチームの不満である。

\if0
Therefore, the first challenge is to create a small set of teams that
implements Scrum well. This set of teams works through organizational
issues that block agility and creates a Reference Model for Scrum that is
known to work in the organization and can be used as a pattern for scaling
Scrum across the organization.
\fi
従って、最初のチャレンジは、スクラムを上手く回す小さなチームのセットを
作成することである。チームのこのセットは、アジリティを阻害する組織的な問題を
通じて働き、組織横断的なスクラムをスケールするためのパターンとして使われうる
リファレンスモデルを作成する。

\if0
As the Reference Model of teams accelerates, impediments and bottlenecks
that delay delivery, produce waste, or impede business agility become
apparent. The most effective way to eliminate these problems is to spread
Scrum across the organization so that the entire value stream is optimized.
\fi
チームのリファレンスモデルが加速すると、デリバリを遅延のもととなる障害物や
ボトルネック、ムダ、ビジネスのアジリティを妨げが見えるようになる。
これらの問題を取り除くための最も効果的な方法は、全体の価値ストリームが最適
化されるように組織横断的にスクラムを広げることである。

\if0
Scrum@Scale achieves linear scaling in productivity by saturating the
organization with Scrum and distributing velocity and quality organically,
consistent with the organization's specific strategy, product, and services.
\fi
Scrum@Scaleは、組織へのスクラムの浸透により、リニアな生産性のスケーリング
を達成する。また、組織の具体的な戦略、プロダクト、およびサービスと整合し、
有機的にベロシティと品質を広げる。

\section{Scrum Master Cycle}
\fi
\section{スクラムマスターサイクル}
\if0
\subsection{Team-Level Process}
\fi
\subsection{チームレベルプロセス}
\if0
The \textbf{Team-Level Process} constitutes the first touch point between the Scrum Master and Product Owner Cycles, and is laid out clearly in the Scrum Guide. It
is composed of three artifacts, five events, and three roles. The goals of
the team level process are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item maximize the flow of completed and quality tested work.
\item increase performance of the team over time.
\item operate in a way that is sustainable and enriching for the team.
\end{itemize}
\fi
\textbf{チームレベルプロセス} はスクラムマスターサイクルとプロダクトオーナーサイクルのファーストタッチポイントを構成する。それは、スクラムガイドではっきりとレイアウトされている。
それは、3つの成果物、5つのイベント3つのルールとして構成されている。そのゴールはチームレベルプロセスを:
\begin{itemize}
\item 完成と品質がテストされた作業のフローの最大化する
\item 時間とともにチームのパフォーマンスが向上する
\item チームが持続可能かつより豊な方法で運用する
\end{itemize}

\if0
\subsection{Coordinating the ``How'' - The Scrum of Scrums}
\fi
\subsection{``どのように'' を調整する - スクラムオブスクラム}
A set of the teams that have a need to coordinate comprise a \textbf{``Scrum of Scrums'' (SoS)}. This team is a Scrum Team unto itself which is responsible for a fully integrated set of potentially shippable increments of product at the end of every Sprint from all participating teams. A SoS functions as a Release Team and must be able to directly deliver value to customers. To do so effectively, it needs to be consistent with the Scrum Guide; that is, have its own roles, artifacts, and events:

Roles:

The SoS needs to have all of the skills necessary to deliver a fully integrated potentially shippable Product Increment at the end of every Sprint. (It may need experienced architects, QA Leaders, and other operational skill sets.) Since the SoS needs to be responsive in real-time to impediments raised by participating teams, the Scrum Masters of the participating teams need to be on the Scrum of Scrums.
It has Product Owner representation to resolve prioritization issues.
The Scrum Master of the Scrum of Scrums is called the \textbf{Scrum of Scrums Scrum Master (SoSM)}.

Events:

A Backlog Refinement event wherein they decide what impediments are ``ready'' to be removed, how best to remove them, and how the team will know it is ``done.''
Particular attention should be paid to the SoS Retrospective in which the teams' representatives share any learnings or process improvements that their individual teams have succeeded with, in order to standardize those practices across the teams within the SoS.
The SoS holds a \textbf{Scaled Daily Scrum (SDS)}. The SDS event mirrors the Daily Scrum in that it optimizes the collaboration and performance of the network of teams. Since the SoS needs to be responsive in real-time to impediments raised by participating teams, the Scrum Masters of the participating teams need to be at the Scaled Daily Scrum. It should also have Product Owner representation to resolve prioritization issues. Any person or number of people from participating teams may attend as needed.

Additionally, the SDS:

\begin{itemize}
\item is time-boxed to 15 minutes or less.
\item must be attended by a representative of each team including the Product Owner team.
\item is a forum where team representatives discuss what is going well, what is getting done, and how teams can work together more effectively. Some examples of what might be discussed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item What impediments does my team have that will prevent them from
accomplishing their Sprint Goal (or impact the upcoming release)?
\item Is my team doing anything that will prevent another team from
accomplishing their Sprint Goal (or impact their upcoming release)?
\item Have we discovered any new dependencies between the teams or
discovered a way to resolve an existing dependency?
\item What improvements have we discovered that can be leveraged across teams?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\if0
\subsection{The Scrum of Scrums Scrum Master (SoSM)}
\fi
\subsection{スクラムオブスクラムマスター (SoSM)}
The Scrum of Scrums Scrum Master (SoSM) is accountable for the release of the
joint teams' effort and must:
\begin{itemize}
\item make progress visible.
\item make an impediment backlog visible to the organization.
\item remove impediments that the teams cannot address themselves.
\item facilitate prioritization of impediments, with particular attention to cross-team
dependencies and the distribution of backlog.
\item improve the efficacy of the Scrum of Scrums.
\item work closely with the Product Owners to deploy a potentially
releasable Product Increment at least every Sprint.
\item coordinate the teams' deployment with the Product Owner's Release
Plans.
\end{itemize}

\if0
\subsection{Scaling the SoS}
\fi
\subsection{SoSのスケーリング}
Depending upon the size of the organization or implementation, more than
one SoS may be needed to deliver a very complex product. In those cases, a
\textbf{Scrum of Scrum of Scrums (SoSoS)} can be created out of multiple
Scrums of Scrums. The SoSoS is an organic pattern of Scrum teams which is
infinitely scalable. Each SoSoS should have SoSoSM's and scaled versions of
each artifact \& event.

Scaling the SoS reduces the number of communication pathways within the
organization so that complexity is encapsulated. The SoSoS interfaces with
a SoS in the exact same manner that a SoS interfaces with a single Scrum
team which allows for linear scalability.

\pagebreak
Sample Diagrams:

\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Sos-R2.png}

\textbf{\textsc{note:}} While the Scrum Guide defines the optimal team size as being
3 to 9 people, Harvard research determined that optimal team size is 4.6
people.\footnote{Hackman, J Richard, Leading teams: Setting the stage for
great performances, Harvard Business Press, 2002} Experiments with high
performing Scrum teams have repeatedly shown that 4 or 5 people doing the
work is the optimal size. It is essential to linear scalability that this
pattern be the same for the number of teams in a SoS. Therefore, in the
above and following diagrams, pentagons were chosen to represent a team of
5. These diagrams are meant to be examples only, your organizational
diagram may differ greatly.

\if0
\subsection{The Executive Action Team}
\fi
\subsection{経営層上位レベルアクションチーム}
The Scrum of Scrums for the entire agile organization is called the
\textbf{Executive Action Team (EAT)}. The leadership team creates an agile bubble
in the organization where the reference model operates with 
its own guidelines and procedures that integrates effectively 
with any part of the organization that is not agile. It owns the agile ecosystem, 
implements the Scrum values, and assures that 
Scrum roles are created and supported.

The EAT is the final stop for
impediments that cannot be removed by the SoS's that feed it. Therefore, it
must be comprised of individuals who are empowered, politically and
financially, to remove them. 
The function of the EAT is to coordinate
multiple SoS's (or SoSoS's). As with any Scrum team, it needs a PO and SM.
It would be best if the EAT met daily as a Scrum team. They must meet at
least once per Sprint and have a transparent backlog.

%\pagebreak
Sample Diagram showing an EAT coordinating 5 groupings of 25 teams:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{SoS-EAT.png}

\if0
\subsection{The EAT's Backlog \& Responsibilities}
\fi
\subsection{EATのバックログと責務}
Scrum is an agile operating system that is different from traditional
project management. The entire SM organization reports into the EAT, which
is responsible for implementing this agile operating system by
establishing, maintaining, and enhancing the implementation in the
organization.
The EAT's role is to create an Organizational Transformation Backlog (a
prioritized list of the agile initiatives that need to be accomplished) and
see that it is carried out. For example, if there is a traditional Product
Development Life Cycle in the old organization, a new agile Product
Development Life Cycle needs to be created, implemented, and supported. It
will typically support quality and compliance issues better than the old
method but be implemented in a different way with different rules and
guidelines. The EAT ensures that a Product Owner organization is created and funded
and that this organization is represented on the EAT to support these efforts.

The EAT is accountable for the quality of Scrum within the organization.
Its responsibilities include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item creating an agile operating system for the Reference Model as it
scales through the organization, including corporate operational rules,
procedures, and guidelines to enable agility.
\item measuring and improving the quality of Scrum in the organization.
\item building capability within the organization for business agility.
\item creating a center for continuous learning for Scrum professionals.
\item supporting the exploration of new ways of working.
\end{itemize}
Finally, the EAT must set up and support a corresponding Product Owner
organization through associations of PO's that mirror the SoS's and scale
their PO functions. These teams of PO's and key stakeholders are known as
\textbf{MetaScrums}.

\if0
\subsection{Outputs/Outcomes of the Scrum Master Cycle}
\fi
\subsection{スクラムマスターサイクルの出力と成果}
The SM organization (SoS, SoSoS, and EAT) work as a whole to complete the
other components of the Scrum Master Cycle: \textbf{Continuous Improvement
and Impediment Removal, Cross-Team Coordination, and Deployment}.

The goals of Continuous Improvement and Impediment Removal are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item identify impediments and reframe them as opportunities.
\item maintain a healthy and structured environment for prioritizing and
removing impediments, and then verifying the resulting improvements.
\item ensure visibility in the organization to effect change.
\end{itemize}
The goals of Cross-Team Coordination are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item coordinate similar processes across multiple related teams.
\item mitigate cross-team dependencies to ensure they don't become
impediments.
\item maintain alignment of team norms and guidelines for consistent output.
\end{itemize}

Since the goal of the SoS is to function as a release team, the deployment
of product falls under their scope, while what is contained in any release
falls under the scope of the Product Owners. Therefore, the goals of the
Deployment are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item deliver a consistent flow of valuable finished product to customers.
\item integrate the work of different teams into one seamless product.
\item ensure high quality of the customer experience.
\end{itemize}

\if0
\section{Product Owner Cycle}
\fi
\section{プロダクトオーナーサイクル}
\if0
\subsection{Coordinating the ``What'' - The MetaScrum}
\fi
\subsection{``何を''を調整する - メタスクラム}
A group of Product Owners who need to coordinate a shared backlog that
feeds a network of teams are themselves a team called a \textbf{MetaScrum}.
For each SoS there is an associated MetaScrum. A MetaScrum aligns the
teams' priorities along a single path so that they can coordinate their
team backlogs and build alignment with stakeholders to support the backlog.
A team's product owner is accoutable for the composition and prioritization
of the team backlog and may pull backlog from the shared metascrum backlog
into the team backlog or generate independent backlog at his or her descretion.

MetaScrums hold a scaled version of Backlog Refinement, the \textbf{Scaled Backlog Refinement Meeting} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each team PO (or proxy) must attend
\item This event is the forum for Leadership, Stakeholders, or other
Customers to express their preferences
\end{itemize}
This event occurs as often as needed, at least once per Sprint, to ensure a
Ready backlog. 

The main functions of the MetaScrum are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item create an overarching vision for the product \& make it visible to
the organization.
\item build alignment with key stakeholders to secure support for backlog
implementation.
\item generate a single, prioritized backlog; ensuring that duplication of
work is avoided.
\item create a minimally uniform ``Definition of Done'' that applies to all teams in
the SoS.
\item eliminate dependencies raised by the SoS.
\item generate a coordinated Release Plan.
\item decide upon and monitor metrics that give insight into the product.
\end{itemize}
MetaScrums, just like SoS's, function as Scrum teams on their own. As such,
they need to have someone who acts as a SM and keeps the team on track in
discussions. They also need a single person who is responsible for coordinating the
generation of a single Product Backlog for all of the teams covered by the
MetaScrum. This person is designated as the \textbf{Chief Product Owner}.

\if0
\subsection{The Chief Product Owner (CPO)}
\fi
\subsection{チーフプロダクトオーナー (CPO)}
Through the MetaScrums, Chief Product Owners coordinate priorities among
Product Owners who work with individual teams. They align backlog
priorities with Stakeholder and Customer needs. Just like a SoSM, they may
be an individual team PO who chooses to play this role as well, or they may
be a person specifically dedicated to this role. Their main
responsibilities are the same as a regular PO's, but at scale:
\begin{itemize}
\item Setting a strategic vision for the whole product.
\item Creating a single, prioritized backlog of value to be delivered by
all of the teams.
\begin{itemize}
\item these items would be larger Product Backlog Items than that for a team PO.
\end{itemize}
\item Working closely with their associated SoSM so that the Release Plan
that the MetaScrum team generates can be deployed efficiently.
\item Monitoring customer product feedback and adjusting the backlog
accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\if0
\subsection{Scaling the MetaScrum}
\fi
\subsection{メタスクラムのスケーリング}
Just as SoS's can grow into SoSoS's, MetaScrums can also expand by the same
mechanism. There is no specific term associated with these expanded units,
nor do the CPO's of them have specific expanded titles. We encourage each
organization to develop their own. For the following diagrams, we have
chosen to add an additional ``Chief'' to the title of those PO's as they
magnify out.

%\pagebreak
Some sample diagrams:

\textbf{NOTE:} As mentioned above, these pentagons represent the ideal
sized Scrum teams and ideal sized MetaScrums. These diagrams are meant to
be examples only, your organizational diagram may differ greatly.

\if0
\subsection{The Executive MetaScrum (EMS)}
\fi
\subsection{エグゼクティブメタスクラム (EMS)}
The MetaScrums enable a network design of Product Owners which is
infinitely scalable alongside their associated SoS's. The MetaScrum for the
entire agile organization is the \textbf{Executive MetaScrum}. The EMS owns
the organizational vision and sets the strategic priorities for the whole
company, aligning all the teams around common goals.

\subsection{Outputs/Outcomes of the Product Owner Organization}
\fi
\subsection{プロダクトオーナー組織の出力と成果}
The PO organization (various MetaScrums, the CPO's, and the Executive
MetaScrum) work as a whole to satisfy the components of the Product Owner
Cycle: \textbf{Strategic Vision, Backlog Prioritization, Backlog
Decomposition \& Refinement, and Release Planning}.

The goals of setting a Strategic Vision are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item clearly align the entire organization along a shared path forward.
\item compellingly articulate why the organization exists.
\item describe what the organization will do to leverage key assets in
support of its mission.
\item respond to rapidly changing market conditions.
\end{itemize}
The goals of Backlog Prioritization are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item identify a clear ordering for products, features, and services to be
delivered.
\item reflect value creation, risk mitigation and internal dependencies in
ordering of the backlog.
\item prioritize the high-level initiatives across the entire agile
organization prior to Backlog Decomposition and Refinement.
\end{itemize}
The goals of Backlog Decomposition \& Refinement are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item break complex products and projects into independent functional
elements that can be completed by one team in one Sprint.
\item capture and distill emerging requirements and customer feedback.
\item ensure all backlog items are truly ``Ready'' so that they can be
pulled by the individual teams.
\end{itemize}
The goals of Release Planning are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item forecast delivery of key features and capabilities.
\item communicate delivery expectations to stakeholders.
\item update prioritization, as needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Understanding Feedback}
\fi
\subsection{フィードバックを理解する}
The \textbf{Feedback} component is the second point where the PO \& SM
Cycles touch. Product feedback drives continuous improvement through
adjusting the Product Backlog while Release feedback drives continuous
improvement through adjusting the Deployment mechanisms. The goals of
obtaining and analyzing Feedback are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item validate our assumptions.
\item understand how customers use and interact with the product.
\item capture ideas for new features and functionality.
\item define improvements to existing functionality.
\item update progress towards product/project completion to refine release
planning and stakeholder alignment.
\item identify improvements to deployment methods and mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics \& Transparency}
\fi
\subsection{メトリクスと透明性}
Radical transparency is essential for Scrum to function optimally, but it
is only possible in an organization that has embraced the Scrum values. It
gives the organization the ability to honestly assess its progress and to
inspect and adapt its products and processes. This is the foundation of the
empirical nature of Scrum as laid out in the Scrum Guide.

Both the SM \& PO Cycles require metrics that will be decided upon by the
separate SM and PO organizations. Metrics may be unique to both specific
organizations as well as to specific functions within those organizations.
Scrum@Scale does not require any specific set of metrics, but it does
suggest that at a bare minimum, the organization should measure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Productivity - e.g. change in amount of Working Product delivered per
Sprint
\item Value Delivery - e.g. business value per unit of team effort
\item Quality - e.g. defect rate or service downtime
\item Sustainability - e.g. team happiness
\end{itemize}
The goals of having Metrics and Transparency are to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item provide all decision makers, including team members, with
appropriate context to make good decisions.
\item shorten feedback cycles as much as possible to avoid over-correction.
\item require minimal additional effort by teams, stakeholders or
leadership.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Some notes on Organizational Design}
\fi
\subsection{組織デザインにおける考慮点}
The scale-free nature of Scrum@Scale allows the design of the organization
to be component-based, just like the framework itself. This permits for
rebalancing or refactoring of teams in response to the market. As an
organization grows, capturing the benefits of distributed teams may be
important. Some organizations reach talent otherwise unavailable and are
able to expand and contract as needed through outsourced development.
Scrum@Scale shows how to do this while avoiding long lag times, compromised
communications, and inferior quality, enabling linear scalability both in
size and global distribution.\footnote{Sutherland, Jeff and Schoonheim,
Guido and Rustenburg, Eelco and Rijk, Maurits, ``Fully distributed scrum:
The secret sauce for hyperproductive offshored development teams'',
AGILE'08. Conference, IEEE: 339-344, 2008}

In this organizational diagram, the \textbf{Knowledge \& Infrastructure
Teams} represent virtual teams of specialists of which there are too few to
staff each team. They coordinate with the Scrum teams as a group via
service-level agreements where requests flow through a PO for each
specialty who converts them into a transparent ordered backlog. An
important note is that these teams are NOT silos of individuals who sit
together (this is why they are represented as hollow pentagons); their team
members sit on the actual Scrum teams, but they make up this virtual Scrum
of their own for the purpose of backlog dissemination and process
improvement.

\textbf{Customer Relations, Legal / Compliance, and People Operations} are
included here since they are necessary parts of organizations and will
exist as independent Scrum teams on their own, which all of the others may
rely upon.

A final note on the representation of the EAT \& EMS: in this diagram, they
are shown as overlapping since some members sit on both of the teams. In very
small organizations or implementations, the EAT \& EMS may consist entirely
of the same team members.

\section{後書}
Scrum@Scale is designed to scale productivity, to get the entire
organization doing twice the work in half the time with higher quality and
in a significantly improved work environment. Large organizations that
properly implement the framework can cut the cost of their products and
services while improving quality and innovation.

Scrum@Scale is designed to saturate an organization with Scrum. All teams,
including Leadership, Human Resources, Legal, Consulting \& Training, and
product \& service teams, implement the same style of Scrum while
streamlining and enhancing an organization.

Well implemented Scrum can run an entire organization.

We acknowledge IDX for the creation of the Scrum of Scrums which first
allowed Scrum to scale to hundreds of teams,\footnote{Sutherland, Jeff,

MetaScrum,\footnote{Sutherland, Jeff, ``Future of scrum: Parallel pipelining
of sprints in complex projects'', Proceedings of the Agile Development
Conference,  IEEE Computer Society 90-102,  2005.} which enabled rapid
deployment of innovative product, and OpenView Venture Partners for scaling
Scrum to the entire organization.\footnote{Sutherland, Jeff and Altman,
Igor, ``Take no prisoners: How a venture capital group does scrum'', Agile
Conference, 2009. AGILE'09, IEEE 350-355.  2009} We value input from Intel
with over 25,000 people doing Scrum who taught us ``nothing scales'' except
a scale-free architecture, and SAP with the largest Scrum team product
organization who taught us management involvement in the MetaScrum is
essential to get 2,000 Scrum teams to work together.

The agile coaches and trainers implementing these concepts at Amazon, GE,
3M, Toyota, Spotify, Maersk, Comcast, AT\&T and many other companies working with Jeff Sutherland
have been helpful in testing these concepts across a wide range of
companies in different domains.

And finally, Avi Schneier and Alex Sutherland have been invaluable in
formulating and editing this document.
